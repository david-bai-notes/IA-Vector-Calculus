\subsection{Bonus: Topology via Calculus and de Rham Cohomology}
If $\underline{F}$ is a vector field with simply connected domain, we know that $\nabla\times\underline{F}=0$ implies that $\underline{F}$ is conservative.
We can conversely use it to show that certain domain is not simply connected.
\begin{example}
    Suppose $\mathbb R\setminus\{(0,0,z):z\in\mathbb R\}$ is simply connected.
    Then consider the vector field
    $$\underline{F}=\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}(-y,x,0)$$
    So it is well defined and smooth on the said domain.
    It also has zero curl.
    So exists scalar function $f$ such that $\underline{F}=\nabla f$, hence the line integral of it along any loop is zero.
    However, let us consider the curve in the $x-y$ plane:
    $$C:[0,2\pi]\ni t\mapsto\begin{pmatrix}
        \cos t\\
        \sin t\\
        0
    \end{pmatrix}$$
    Then
    $$\int_C\underline{F}\cdot\mathrm d\underline{x}=2\pi\neq 0$$
    Contradiction.
\end{example}
