\subsection{Bonus: Discrete Laplacian}
If we have $\varphi:\mathbb Z^n\to\mathbb Z$, we can define
$$\nabla^2\varphi(\underline{a})=\frac{1}{2n}\sum_{i=1}^n(\varphi(\underline{a}+\underline{e_i})+\varphi(\underline{a}-\underline{e_i}))-\phi(\underline{a})$$
We can show that if $\varphi$ is harmonic and bounded, then it is constant.
Indeed the set $\phi(\mathbb Z^n)$ is finite if $\phi$ is bounded, hence has a least element.
It is then trivial to show, by following the grid, that $\phi$ attains the value of the least element everywhere.
