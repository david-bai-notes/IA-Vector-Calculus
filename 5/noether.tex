\subsection{Bonus: Noether's Theorem}
If a system of differential equations admits a (translational, rotational, etc.) symmetry, then something is conserved.
It is a very pure theorem but has significant physical meanings.
So the conservation laws in mathematical physics arises naturally from the time independence, spacial independence or directional independence of a physical law.
