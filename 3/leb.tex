\subsection{Bonus: Lebesgue Integral}
If we want to find the area under a curve, we choose to slice up the horizontal region (domain) of the function (Riemannian integration).
But can we choose to slice up the vertical region that is the range of the function?
This is known as the Lebesgue integration.
Sometimes this is better.
For example if we want to integrate $f(x)=1_{\mathbb Q}$, Riemannian integration would not work if we want to evaluate
$$\int_0^1f(x)\,\mathrm dx$$
But if we do it by Lebesgue intgeral, but since $\mathbb Q$ is countable
\footnote{Hence of Lebesgue measure $0$.}
this integral is obviously $0$.
